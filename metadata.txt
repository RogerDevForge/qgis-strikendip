about=Strike and Dip Visualizer is a QGIS plugin designed to simplify the process of recording and visualizing structural geological measurements. Developed at the Institute of Mine Surveying and Geodesy at TU Bergakademie Freiberg, this tool allows geologists, mining engineers, and earth science students to quickly document strike and dip measurements directly on their maps. The plugin enables users to place properly oriented structural symbols at map locations with associated metadata including geological unit, measurement values, confidence levels, and automatic timestamps. By streamlining the documentation of structural data, Strike and Dip Visualizer helps create more intuitive geological maps that enhance interpretation and analysis of subsurface formations. Whether you're conducting field campaigns, analyzing structural trends, or teaching geological concepts, this plugin provides a straightforward solution for managing structural orientation data within your QGIS projects.
